                <p>
                             I often wonder if my life would have been different if I hadn’t loved my grandfather so much. Maybe if I’d been a more distant child, less attached to the old man who filled my days with joy, I wouldn’t have ended up where I am now. But that’s not who I was. I was Leo Silva, a boy who thought his grandfather hung the moon and stars.
                    <br><br>
                    It was April 2032, and spring was in full bloom in our neighbourhood. Trees painted the streets green, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of new beginnings. But for me, it was the beginning of the end.
                    <br><br>
                    I remember that morning as if it was yesterday. The sun had barely peeked over the horizon when I heard my mother’s scream.
                    <br><br>
                    I was just five at that time.
                    <br><br>
                    The scream tore through the house. I got out of my bed, my heart pounding in my chest.
                    <br><br>
                    “Father! Father, please wake up!”
                    <br><br>
                    Her voice was full of desperation. I ran towards my grandfather’s room. The door was wide open, and I could see my mother hunched over the bed, shaking the still form of my grandfather.
                    <br><br>
                    “Grandpa?” I called out.
                    <br><br>
                    My mother turned to me, her eyes full of tears. 
                    <br><br>
                    “Go back to your room, Now!” she said, but I couldn’t move. My eyes were fixed on my grandfather’s face.
                    <br><br>
                    He looked… peaceful. Like he was just sleeping. I didn’t understand what happened to him at that time.
                    <br><br>
                    “Is Grandpa okay?” I asked with my innocent voice.
                    <br><br>
                    My mother came to me. She kneed down and hugged me. “Grandpa… Grandpa has gone to sleep… and… and he won’t wake up.” 
                    <br><br>
                    I didn’t understand. How could someone sleep and never wake up? It didn’t make sense.
                    <br><br>
                    Then, the innocent child spoke.
                    <br><br>
                    “But… but he promised to take me to the park today…”
                    <br><br>
                    Those words hit my mother hard. She held me tighter, her body shaking. “I’m so sorry, sweetheart… I’m so, so sorry.”
                    <br><br>
                    The time flew within the next few hours: people came and went, police officers, doctor, some relatives whom I had never met. They spoke among themselves in hushed tones, treating me with sympathetic eyes. I, however, was too distracted to pay attention to all that; my mind was with my grandfather.
                    <br><br>
                    He was more that a grandfather to me. He was my best friend, my personal hero. He always had time for me, always had a story to tell or a game to play. He would sit me on his knee and tell me about his work. I didn’t understand most of it, but I loved the way his eyes would light up when he talked about science and things I couldn’t even pronounce.
                    <br><br>
                    As the day goes on, the reality of what had happened began to sink in. 
                    <br><br>
                    Grandpa was gone. 
                    <br><br>
                    He wouldn’t be there to tuck me in at night, to chase the monsters under my bed. He wouldn’t be there to teach me how to ride a bike or to cheer me on my first school day. The weight of his loss pressed down on me, making it hard to breathe.
                    <br><br>
                    That night, as I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, I felt something inside me break. The world suddenly seemed too big, too scary without my grandfather in it. 
                    <br><br>
                    I closed my eyes, wishing that when I open my eyes, this would all be a bad dream. That Grandpa would be there, smiling and ready to take me to the park.
                    <br><br>
                    But when I opened my eyes, nothing had changed. The world was still empty, still wrong. I felt myself slipping away. It was easier than facing a world without Grandpa. Easier than trying to understand why he had left me.
                    All I knew was that I wanted to sleep. To escape. And so I did, slipping into a deep void that would hold me for far longer than anyone could expect.

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>
                             I opened my eyes and started blinking because the bright light bothered my eyes. Everything around was some kind of white blur; there were some beeping sounds. When my sight began to clear up, I realized I was lying in the hospital bed with some weird machines around me.
                    <br><br>
                    “He’s awake!” a voice exclaimed.
                    <br><br>
                    I tried to speak, but my throat was dry. A nurse showed up by my side, helping me to sit and offering me a glass of water. As I took a sip of it, I noticed how weak my arms felt, how difficult it was to hold the glass steady.
                    <br><br>
                    “Leo”, a doctor called my name, his face was a mix of relief and concern. “How are you feeling?”
                    <br><br>
                    I opened my mouth to speak, but I was startled when I saw my reflection in the window behind him. The face staring back at me wasn’t the one I remember. It was older, sharper.
                    <br><br>
                    “Wh- what happened to me?”
                    <br><br>
                    The doctor and nurse stared at each other, a silent conversation between them. Finally, the doctor took a deep breath and said: “Leo… You’ve been asleep for twelve years.”
                    <br><br>
                    What did he say? Twelve years? Is this some kind of a joke? It couldn’t be possible. The last thing I remember was…
                    <br><br>
                    Suddenly, memories came back to me. My grandfather, found dead in his bed. The grief and depression that overwhelmed me.
                    <br><br>
                    And then… nothing.
                    <br><br>
                    “Your family is here” the nurse said, interrupting my thoughts. “They’ve been waiting for you to wake up. Would you like to see them?”
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, still trying to process what have been said to me. Moments later, the door opened, and familiar yet odd faces rushed in. My mother, with streaks of grey in her hair. My father, whose hair was completely white, and his eyes were small and tired. And a girl I didn’t recognize at all.
                    <br><br>
                    She was a young teenager.
                    <br><br>
                    “Leo!” my mother cried, tears running down her face as she hugged me. It was warm.
                    <br><br>
                    “I can’t believe you’re awake, son” my father said, like someone who found his missing thing.
                    <br><br>
                    Well, I was missing from their life for over a decade.
                    <br><br>
                    My mother still hugging me, I saw that girl again. She stood awkwardly at the end of the bed, her eyes filled with tears.
                    <br><br>
                    Suddenly, I noticed some features of my baby sister in her.
                    <br><br>
                    “Yuki?” I said with a low voice.
                    <br><br>
                    She nodded with a smile and a face full of tears. “Yes… It’s me Yuki… It’s me, your sister.”
                    <br><br>
                    My family surrounded me, full of joy and relief, but I felt overwhelmed. Twelve years had passed, that’s a lot, the world had moved on while I was sleeping. I had so much to catch up to, so much to learn.

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>
                             The next two months were full of therapy sessions, medical tests, and attempts to catch up on the twelve years I lost. It was exhausting, both physically and mentally.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, the day came when I was discharged from the hospital. As we drove home, I pressed my face against the car window, looking at the city that changed a lot. There were buildings that looked futuristic. Holographic ads floated in the air, and people walked by with devices attached to their wrists rather that the phones I recall when I was little.
                    <br><br>
                    “It’s a lot, isn’t it?” my father said, noticing my wide eyes. I nodded.
                    <br><br>
                    “What year we’re in now?” I asked, still amazed by what I saw. “It’s 2044,” Yuki answered.
                    <br><br>
                    When we arrived home, I was shocked again. Our house that I remember had been replaced by a new one. Not the house itself, but what’s inside of it. It looked a bit more futuristic.
                    <br><br>
                    “Your room is upstairs…” my mother said. “We’ve kept it… well, we’ve tried to keep it as you left it.”
                    <br><br>
                    I entered my room, it was just the same as I remember it. My old drawings still on the walls, my books still on the shelf. But there was also a device on my desk, It didn’t look like a computer at all, it was some different.
                    <br><br>
                    “We thought you might want to catch up on things” Yuki said, stepping into the room behind me. She walked to that device on the desk. “This is is the new generation of computers,” She said while turning it on, a hologram appeared. 
                    <br><br>
                    “It doesn’t require a screen or a mouse or a keyboard either, you just put on this on your wrist and control it with your brain”
                    <br><br>
                    I was shocked, Technology advanced this much in just twelve years, I remember computer setups required a lot space and components, but now it’s just a rod connected to the power outlet, and a thing that you put on your wrist connected to it.
                    <br><br>
                    Man… That’s too much…
                    <br><br>
                    Yuki started showing me what I needed to learn to catch up, it was a long list, very long list.
                    <br><br>
                    “It’s… a lot…” I admitted.
                    <br><br>
                    Yuki smiled. “Take it one day at a time, there is no rush, take your time.”
                    <br><br>
                    It looked like Yuki knows so much about technology, even though she’s still 12.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the next few weeks, I was learning. I didn’t knew the world could advance so much in twelve years. Clean energy had replaced fossil fuels, medical breakthroughs for several diseases, and all sorts of discoveries in physiques, chemistry and biology.
                    <br><br>
                    But something felt wrong, something that isn’t in its place. All I remember before the coma about my grandfather’s death felt… like it wasn’t right. Why had that event affected me so much? And why do I feel that there is more to the story?

            <h1 class="title">Chapter III <br><span>( Chapter 3 )</span></h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>	         It was a quiet evening, about a month after I had returned home. I was in my room, doing some maths problems on the computer, trying to solve them as quickly as possible. I got tired, and I decided to take a break.
                    <br><br>
                    As I made my way downstairs for a snack, I heard the clatter of the mail slot. Curious, I went to check it out. Among the usual bills and ads, there was a plain white envelope. It was addressed simply to “Leo Silva”, with nothing else.
                    <br><br>
                    Who could be writing to me? Everyone I knew was aware that I had just woken up. I got back to my room and carefully opened the envelope.
                    <br><br>
                    Inside was a single sheet of paper with a message:
                    <br><br>
                    <i>“ Dear Leo,<br><br>
                                       If you want to know the truth, come to the abandoned Luminari High School today at midnight. <br><br> Alone.”</i>
                    <br><br>
                    I read the message once, twice. No, I read it multiple times, making sure I’m reading it correctly.
                    <br><br>
                    The Truth? What truth? And why meet at an abandoned school in the middle of the night?
                    <br><br>
                    Part of me knew it was ridiculous to even consider going. It could be a dangerous trap, or just some stupid prank. But another part of me knew that I need to go, I need to check what is it. It was burning with curiosity.
                    <br><br>
                    I spent the rest of the day distracted, barely able to focus on my studies. At dinner, I pushed my food around the plate, lost in thoughts.
                    <br><br>
                    “Leo? Are you feeling alright?” my mother asked with concern.
                    <br><br>
                    I forced a smile. 
                    <br><br>
                    “Just tired, I guess.”
                    <br><br>
                    As the night fell, I made my decision. I had to know what this was about. I waited until I was sure everyone else was asleep, then quietly made my way downstairs. 
                    <br><br>
                    I left a note saying I had gone for a walk, just in case anyone woke up and found me missing.
                    <br><br>
                    And then, I got out.</p>

                <p>
                             The night air was cold. My heart pounding faster with each moment, a mix of fear and excitement. The letter I received earlier that day was still in my mind.
                    <br><br>
                    To be honest, I had a thought that I was walking into a trap, or some kind of a prank, but the curiosity to know was too strong.
                    <br><br>
                    When I got closer to the school, it seemed to me that it was not alive any more which reached its dying days – the building was broken and pale in front of the starry night. The gate to the area was locked, so I had to look for a place to hop over the fence that enclosed the compound. Upon touching the ground on the other side, I inhaled deeply as I prepared for whatever was waiting for me next.
                    <br><br>
                    The corridors were uncomfortably silent as I made my way through the abandoned building. Moonlight coming through the broken windows, casting long shadows which made the place even scarier.To make it even worse, the floor creaked as I walked. 
                    <br><br>
                    This is hell!
                    <br><br>
                    Suddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. My heart was rushing, and without thinking, I started running as fast as I could. The footsteps were getting closer. I was in such panic I realized I didn’t know where I was going.
                    <br><br>
                    I spotted a door with a faint light coming from underneath. It was my only option. I sprinted towards it, opened it, and slammed it shut behind me. I leaned against the door trying to catch my breath.
                    <br><br>
                    I found myself at the top of staircase. The source of the light was coming from below. I began to descend slowly, careful with each step.
                    <br><br>
                    At the bottom, I saw another door. This one was different - it looked like a lab door rather than a school one. I reached for the handle, but it was stuck. No matter how hard I pushed or pulled, it wouldn’t budge.
                    <br><br>
                    Exhausted, I sat on the floor. What was I even doing here? This whole situation seemed insane. As I sat there, thinking of what should I do next, I heard a click.
                    <br><br>
                    The door slowly swung open.

                             My breath caught in my throat as the door revealed a tall man, probably in his fifties. His face was aged and worried, but his eyes tell a different story.
                    <br><br>
                    “Leo,” he said. “I’ve been waiting for you. Please, come in.”
                    <br><br>
                    I hesitated at first, but I had come this far, and the promise of answers was too tempting to resist. Swallowing my fear, I stepped in.
                    <br><br>
                    The room was filled with equipments I couldn’t even begin to understand. Computers, strange devices blinking. The man led me to a chair, and I sat down, my legs feeling weak.
                    <br><br>
                    “My name in Felix” he began. “I was your grandfather’s research partner.”
                    <br><br>
                    My eyes widened. “You know my grandfather?”
                    <br><br>
                    Felix nodded with a sad smile on his face. “He was a brilliant man, and a good friend. But his brilliance… it got him killed.”
                    <br><br>
                    “What do you mean by killed?! ”
                    <br><br>
                    “Your grandfather was murdered while he was asleep by a secret organization called Kagami. They wanted his research, but he refused to give it to them. You see, Sato had discovered something incredible - something that could change the world. But in the wrong hands, it could be catastrophic.”
                    <br><br>
                    As Felix spoke, I felt myself sinking. My grandfather, murdered? A secret organization? It all seemed too fantastical to be true. And yet, deep down, I knew he was telling the truth.
                    <br><br>
                    “But what does this have to do with me?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.
                    <br><br>
                    “Before your grandfather died, he did something… unprecedented. He injected you with a chemical compound that altered your DNA. He believed that if anyone could control what I’m about to show you, it would be you, Leo.”
                    <br><br>
                    My head was spinning. I had so many questions, but before I could even speak, Felix stood and walked over to a nearby table. He pressed a button, and a hologram appeared on top of it.
                    <br><br>
                    It was a bracelet, sleek and futuristic. I stared at it, mesmerized.
                    <br><br>
                    “This” Felix said, “is what your grandfather gave his life for.”

                <p>
                             I couldn’t take my eyes off the holographic bracelet floating in front of me. It seemed to pulse with an energy of its own, drawing me in like a mosquito to a light bulb.
                    <br><br>
                    “What… what is this?” I asked.
                    <br><br>
                    “This bracelet is the culmination of your grandfather’s life’s work. When implanted in a host body, it allows them to focus their energy and transform it into almost anything.”
                    <br><br>
                    I blinked, trying to process his words. “Transform energy into… anything? How is that even possible?”
                    <br><br>
                    “It’s based on the Theory of Relativity and Quantum physics,” Felix continued. “The bracelet draws energy from the body and convert it into matter. Your grandfather believed that with the right host - someone with the ability to store and control vast amounts of energy - the possibilities would be limitless.”
                    <br><br>
                    My mind was reeling. It all sounded like something out of a science fiction novel. And yet, as I looked at the hologram, I noticed a strange feeling within me, as if some part of me recognized the truth in Felix’s words.
                    <br><br>
                    “And you think I’m this… host?” I asked.
                    <br><br>
                    Felix nodded. “Your grandfather altered your DNA for this very purpose, Leo. Your body can store and manipulate energy in ways that no one else can. But it’s not just about the bracelet anymore. Kagami knows you’re awake now, and they want more than just the device. They want you.”
                    <br><br>
                    A chill ran down my spine at his words. The weight of responsibility settled on my shoulders, heavy and suffocating. I thought of my family, unaware of the danger lurking in the shadows. Of the world I had just reawakened to, still so new and unfamiliar.
                    <br><br>
                    “What… what do you want me to do?” I asked, though I already knew the answer.
                    <br><br>
                    “I want you to continue your grandfather’s work, Leo. To master the bracelet’s power and use it to stop Kagami. It won’t be easy. The risks are enormous, possibly even fatal. But you might be our only hope.”
                    <br><br>
                    That’s too much responsibility. What should I do? Decline the offer and continue to live a normal life? Or accept it for my grandfather’s trust in me?

                <p>
                             I stood there, my heart pounding in my chest as I looked at Felix. The bracelet project, my grandfather’s legacy, and the key to unlock unimaginable power - it was all real, and it was right in front of me.
                    <br><br>
                    “So, Leo,” Felix’s voice cut through my thoughts, “what do you say? Are you willing to take on this responsibility?”
                    <br><br>
                    I swallowed hard, my mind racing. On one hand, the idea of having such incredible abilities was exhilarating. On the other hand, the dangers were clear. Kagami was after me, and this bracelet could change my life forever - for better or worse.
                    <br><br>
                    “What are the risks?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.
                    <br><br>
                    “The implantation process is delicate. There’s a chance of rejection, and in the worst case… it could be fatal.”
                    <br><br>
                    I felt a chill run down my spine. Fatal?! That’s the last word I wanted to hear. But then I thought of my grandfather, of his dedication to this project, and the threat Kagami posed on the world.
                    <br><br>
                    Taking a deep breath, I looked Felix in the eyes. “I’ll do it.”
                    <br><br>
                    A mix of relief and concern appeared on Felix’s face. He nodded  and gestured for me to follow him. “Then let’s begin.”
                    <br><br>
                    As he led me to a small room where the implantation would take place, I couldn’t help but feel a mix of fear and excitement. In just a few short hours, my life had changed forever.
                    <br><br>
                    And as I lay on the operating table, watching Felix prepare for the procedure, I knew that nothing would ever be the same again.

                <p>
                             The walk home from the lab was a blur. My head spinning from everything that had happened. As I approached my house, a new challenge presented itself: how was I going to explain all of this to my family?
                    <br><br>
                    I stopped at the front door, taking a deep breath to compose myself. The bandage on my arm felt conspicuous. With a sigh, I pushed the door open.
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m home!” I called out.
                    <br><br>
                    My mother’s voice coming from the kitchen. “Leo? Where have you been? I was worried!”
                    <br><br>
                    I stepped into the kitchen, where my parents and sister Yuki were gathered. Their eyes immediately zeroed in on my bandaged arm.
                    <br><br>
                    “What happened?” my father asked with concern.
                    <br><br>
                    I smiled nervously. “I, uh, had a bit of an accident while walking down the street. Tripped and fell on my arm. The doctor said it’s just a sprain, nothing serious.” 
                    <br><br>
                    My mother rushed over, fussing over my arm. “Oh, sweetie! You need to be more careful.”
                    <br><br>
                    As she examined the bandaged, I felt a pang of guilt. I hated lying to them, but I knew it was necessary. How could I possibly explain the truth?
                    <br><br>
                    Yuki, however, was looking at me suspiciously. “What did you even go walking at night? Isn’t that very dangerous.   ”
                    <br><br>
                    I swallowed hard, searching for a believable answer. “I… I just couldn’t sleep and needed something to do. So, I went for a walk.”
                    <br><br>
                    Yuki didn’t look entirely convinced, but she didn’t press further. As my family continued to fuss over me, I couldn’t help but feel the weight of my secret pressing down on me. This was just the beginning, I realized. From now on, I would have to live a double life, constantly balancing between the truth and the lies I’d have to tell to protect it.
                    <br><br>
                    That night, as I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, I wondered if I had made the right choice. The path ahead was fraught with danger and deception. But as I thought of the power growing within me and the threat of Kagami looming over the world, I knew there was no turning back now. Whatever challenges lay ahead, I would face them head-on.

                <p>
                             After two months of the surgery, I returned back to Felix’s lab to continue what I had started. I knew that the real challenge was just beginning. I stood there, in the center of the lab, my arm still bandaged and sore from the implantation.
                    <br><br>
                    “Alright, Leo” Felix said, coming to a stop in front of me. “It’s time to see what you can do.”
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, trying to ignore the nervousness in my stomach.
                    <br><br>
                    He pointed to a small pencil on a nearby table. “Start simple. Try to move that pencil without touching it.”
                    <br><br>
                    I focused on the pencil, willing it to move. 
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing happened. 
                    <br><br>
                    I furrowed my brow, concentrating harder.
                    <br><br>
                    Still nothing.
                    <br><br>
                    “Remember, the bracelet channels your energy. You need to feel it flowing through you, then direct it towards the pencil.”
                    <br><br>
                    I closed my eyes, trying to sense this energy Felix spoke of. At first, there was nothing. Then, slowly, I became aware of a warn sensation in arm, right where the bracelet was implanted. I focused on that feeling, imaging it spreading through my body and extending towards the pencil.
                    <br><br>
                    When I opened my eyes, the pencil was vibrating slightly. I felt a surge of excitement going through me, and for a moment, the pencil lifted a fraction of an inch off the table before falling back down.
                    <br><br>
                    Exhaustion hit me like a wave, and I stumbled back, catching myself on a nearby chair.
                    <br><br>
                    Felix’s hand was on my shoulder, steadying me. “Well done, Leo. That’s enough for today.”
                    <br><br>
                    As I caught my breath, a small smile crept onto my face. It wasn’t much, but it was a start. And for the first time since waking up, I felt a glimmer of hope for the future.

                             As I stood there in the dimly lit laboratory, sweat beading on my brow, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. It had been weeks since I first attempted to move objects with my mind, and now, finally, I was seeing real progress.
                    <br><br>
                    "Excellent work, Leo" Felix said with a wide smile on face. 'You're progressing faster than I anticipated.'
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, trying to hide my exhaustion. "Thank you, Mr. Felix. But I still have a long way to go, don't I?"
                    <br><br>
                    He chuckled. "Indeed. Moving small objects is just the beginning. Soon, we'll move on to more complex manipulations."
                    <br><br>
                    I flexed my fingers, feeling the strange tingle of energy coursing through them. The bracelet hidden beneath my skin pulsed with each heartbeat, always reminding me of the power - and responsibility - I now carried.
                    <br><br>
                    "Mr. Felix" I began hesitantly, "do you really think I can master all of this power? It… It seems impossible."
                    <br><br>
                    "Leo, your grandfather believed in you. He saw potential in you that you can't yet see in yourself. Trust in that."
                    <br><br>
                    With those words, I felt a surge of determination. I may have lost twelve years of my life, but I wouldn't waste a single moment more. I had to become stronger, to understand this power, to protect those I cared about from the shadows that lurked in the corners of this world.
                    <br><br>
                    I straightened my back, "Let's continue. I'm ready for the next challenge."
                    <br><br>
                    Felix nodded approvingly. "Very well. Let's see how you can handle multiple objects at once."
                    <br><br>
                    As the training continues, I felt a mix of accomplishment and concern. Even though I just started, I felt that I had a very long way to go. And who knows when will Kagami find us.

                <p>         The rough texture of the stone grated against my palm as I concentrated, willing the jagged rock to change shape. Sweat dripped down my face, my jaw clenched in determination. Slowly, agonizingly, the edges began to smooth out, the rock morphing into a perfect sphere.
                    <br><br>
                    "Well done." Felix's voice broke through my intense focus. "You're making remarkable progress with solid manipulation."
                    <br><br>
                    I let out a breath, the stone sphere dropping into my hand. "Thank you, Mr. Felix. But it's still so difficult. Every different material requires a unique approach."
                    <br><br>
                    He nodded sagely. "That's the nature of energy manipulation. Each element, each state of matter, has its own… personality, if you will. You must learn to communicate with it, to understand its essence."
                    <br><br>
                    I turned the stone over in my hand, fascinated at its perfectly smooth surface. It was hard to believe that just a month ago, I could barely lift a pencil. Now, I was reshaping matter itself. The progress was exhilarating, but also terrifying. With each new skill I mastered, the weight of responsibility grew heavier.
                    <br><br>
                    But something was concerning me. "Mr. Felix, what if Kagami finds out about my training? What if they come after my family?"
                    <br><br>
                    "That's precisely why we must continue, Leo. The stronger you become, the better equipped you'll be to protect those you love."
                    <br><br>
                    I thought of my parents, of my sister Yuki. They had no idea of the danger that lurked in the shadows, of the power that now coursed through my veins. I had to become stronger, for their sake.
                    <br><br>
                    "Let's continue" I said, setting the stone sphere aside. "What's next?"
                    <br><br>
                    Felix smiled. "I think it's time we move on to something a bit more… challenging. Tell me, Leo, how do you feel about working with metal?"
                    <br><br>
                    As I saw the shining ingot of steel in front of me, I knew I had a long way to go. But with each challenge overcome, with each new skill mastered, I was one step closer to becoming the protector my family -and the world- needed me to be.</p>

                <p>         The gentle breeze caressed my face as I stood in the open field behind the abandoned school. It was refreshing to get out of Felix's lab to train once in a while.
                    <br><br>
                    "Remember, Leo. Gases are not just about force. It's about finesse, about understanding the currents and flows that exist all around us."
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, closing my eyes and extending my senses. The bracelet hummed beneath my skin, resonating with the energy that permeated the air. Slowly, carefully, I began to exert my will upon the invisible currents.

                    At first, nothing seemed to happen. Then, gradually, I felt the air around me shift and change. A small whirlwind formed at my feet, kicking up dust and leaves. Encouraged, I pushed harder, willing the vortex to grow.
                    <br><br>
                    The wind picked up speed, howling around me. Leaves and small branches were torn from nearby trees, caught in the maelstrom of my creation. For a moment, I felt a surge of elation at my success.
                    <br><br>
                    Then, suddenly, it all spiralled out of control.
                    <br><br>
                    The whirlwind expanded rapidly, growing far beyond what I had intended. I could hear Felix shouting something, but his words were lost in the roar of the wind. Panic gripped me as I realized I couldn't stop what I had started.
                    <br><br>
                    "Focus, Leo!" I finally managed to hear Felix. "Don't fight it. Guide it!"
                    <br><br>
                    I took a deep breath, centering myself. Instead of trying to forcefully stop the whirlwind, I visualized its energy, its flow. Gradually, I began to guide it, like a shepherd herding an unruly flock.
                    <br><br>
                    Slowly, agonizingly, the wind began to calm. The vortex shrank, the howling died down to a whisper, and finally, all was still.
                    <br><br>
                    I opened my eyes, panting heavily. The field around us was a mess of scattered leaves and broken branches. Felix stood a short distance away, his hair and clothes dishevelled but a proud smile on his face.
                    <br><br>
                    "An excellent lesson," he said, approaching me. "You've learned first-hand both the power and danger of gas manipulation."
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, still catching my breath. "I… I lost control. It was terrifying."
                    <br><br>
                    As we walked back to the lab, discussing the finer points of my performance, I couldn't shake the lingering sense of unease. The power I was learning to wield was immense, capable of great good but also terrible destruction. The responsibility was heavy.
                    <br><br>
                    But as I thought of my family, of the threat that Kagami posed to everything I held dear, I knew I had no choice but to continue. I had to master this power, to become strong enough to protect those I loved.
                    <br><br>
                    The wind had changed, and I had to change with it.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Chapter XIII <br><span>( Chapter 13 )</span></h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>         As I stood by the edge of a small pond near Felix's lab, I took a deep breath and focused my energy. The task in front of me seemed impossible - controlling liquids. After mastering solids and gases, I thought this would be easier, but I was sorely mistaken.
                    <br><br>
                    "Remember, Leo" Felix said from behind, "water is alive. It flows, it adapts. You must become one with it."
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, extending my hand towards the pond's surface. Concentrating hard, I tried to lift a small column of water. At first, nothing happened. Then, ever so slowly, a thin stream began to rise.
                    <br><br>
                    "That's it!" Felix exclaimed. "Now, try to shape it."
                    <br><br>
                    As soon as I attempted to mold the water, it collapsed, splashing back into the pond. I gritted my teeth in frustration.
                    <br><br>
                    "This is impossible." I said.
                    <br><br>
                    Felix placed a hand on my shoulder. "Nothing is impossible, Leo. Your grandfather believed in you. I believe in you. Now, try again."
                    <br><br>
                    Taking another deep breath, I reached out once more. This time, I imagined the water as an extension of myself. To my surprise, a larger column rose from the pond. Carefully, I began to shape it into a sphere.
                    <br><br>
                    "Excellent!" Felix cheered.
                    <br><br>
                    Just as I was about to celebrate my success, the sphere burst, drenching me from head to toe. Felix couldn't help but laugh, and soon, I found myself joining in.
                    <br><br>
                    "Well," I said, wiping water from my eyes, "at least I'm staying hydrated."</p>

        <div class="page" id="ch14">
            <h1 class="title">Chapter XIV <br><span>( Chapter 14 )</span></h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>         Weeks had passed since I began my training with liquids, and while I had made progress, I was eager to move on to the next challenge - plasma manipulation. As Felix led me to a specially prepared area of the lab, I could feel my heart racing with excitement and apprehension.
                    <br><br>
                    "Now, Leo," Felix began, his voice serious, "plasma is the most dangerous state of matter we've worked with so far. It's unpredictable, volatile, and incredibly hot. We'll start with something simple - a small flame."
                    <br><br>
                    He lit a candle and placed it in front of me. "Try to control it, make it dance to your will."
                    <br><br>
                    I focused on the tiny flame, reaching out with my energy. At first, nothing happened. Then, slowly, the flame began to flicker and sway in response to my commands.
                    <br><br>
                    "Good." Felix nodded. "Now, try to make it grow."
                    <br><br>
                    Concentrating harder, I poured more energy into the flame. Suddenly, it erupted into a pillar of fire, nearly singeing my eyebrows. I stumbled back, startled by the intensity.
                    <br><br>
                    "Careful!" Felix warned, quickly extinguishing the flame. "Too much energy, too fast. You must learn to control the flow precisely."
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, felling embarrassed. "Let's try again."
                    <br><br>
                    For hours, we worked on controlling flames of various sizes. By the end of the session, I was exhausted and exhilarated. I had managed to create and manipulate plasma with a level of control I never thought possible.
                    <br><br>
                    As we finished for the day, Felix looked at me with a mixture of pride and concern. "You're progressing faster than I anticipated, Leo. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. We must be cautious."
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, understanding the weight of his words. Little did I know how foreshadowing they would prove to be.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>         As weeks turned into months, my training intensified. I was now to manipulate all four states of matter with increasing proficiency. However, with each passing day, I could sense a growing tension in Felix.
                    <br><br>
                    One evening, as we concluded our training session, Felix motioned for me to sit. I could clearly see worry in his face.
                    <br><br>
                    "Leo…" he began with a low voice, "I've received more disturbing news about Kagami's activities. They're getting closer to discovering our location."
                    <br><br>
                    A chill ran down my spine. "What does this mean for us?"
                    <br><br>
                    Felix sighed heavily. "It means we need to accelerate your training. You're progressing well, but you're not ready to face them yet. And I fear we may not have as much time as we initially thought."
                    <br><br>
                    I clenched my fists. "What can we do?"
                    <br><br>
                    "We'll need to focus on combining your skills, creating more complex manipulations. And… we may need to consider offensive techniques." Felix explained.
                    <br><br>
                    The gravity of the situation hit me. Up until now, my training had been focused on control and manipulation. The idea of using these powers as weapons… it was both thrilling and terrifying.
                    <br><br>
                    "I understand, I'm ready for whatever comes next." I said.
                    <br><br>
                    Felix smiled sadly. "I hope you are, my boy. I truly hope you are."
                    <br><br>
                    As I left the lab that night, walking home under the light of the moon, I couldn't shake the feeling that my life was about to change drastically. The weight of responsibility settled heavily on my shoulders, and I knew that the peaceful days of my youth were coming to an end.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="page" id="ch16">
            <h1 class="title">Chapter XVI <br><span>( Chapter 16 )</span></h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>         I woke up that morning with a strange feeling in my gut. Something was off, but I couldn't put my finger on it. As I made my way to the lab for another training session with Felix, the air felt heavy, charged with an invisible tension.
                    <br><br>
                    "Focus, Leo," Felix's voice cut through my thoughts. "Today, we're going to push your limits."
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, trying to shake off the unease. We had been training for months, and I had made significant progress in manipulating energy. But today, Felix seemed more intense than usual.
                    <br><br>
                    As I began concentrate, channelling energy through the bracelet embedded in my arm, a loud crash echoed through the lab. Felix and I exchanged alarmed glances.
                    <br><br>
                    "Kagami," he whispered, his face pale. "They've found us."
                    <br><br>
                    Before I could react, the door burst open. Men in black uniforms swarmed in, their eyes cold. I recognized the emblem on their jackets - Kagami, the organization that killed my grandfather.
                    <br><br>
                    "Leo, run!" Felix shouted, positioning himself between me and the intruders.
                    <br><br>
                    I hesitated, torn between fleeing and helping my mentor. But as the first blows were exchanged, I realized I was out of my depth. Felix moved with a grace I had never seen before, his firsts connecting with deadly precision.
                    <br><br>
                    "Go!" he yelled again. "You're the only one who can stop them now!"
                    <br><br>
                    With a heavy heart, I turned and ran towards the emergency exit. The sound of fighting faded behind me as I raced up the hidden staircase, my mind reeling. How had Kagami found us? What would happen to Felix?
                    <br><br>
                    As I emerged into the sunlight, gasping for air, I knew that my life would never be the same again.</p>

        <div class="page" id="ch17">
            <h1 class="title">Chapter XVII <br><span>( Chapter 17 )</span></h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>         My lungs burned as I ran through the streets, trying to put as much distance between myself and the lab as possible. But the sounds of pursuit were growing closer. I ducked into an alley, my heart pounding in my chest.
                    <br><br>
                    "There he is!" a gruff voice shouted.
                    <br><br>
                    They spotted me.
                    <br><br>
                    I turned to face my pursuers, my hand instinctively going to the bracelet in my arm. There were three of them, all armed and looking far more experienced than me.
                    <br><br>
                    "Surrender, boy," one of them growled. "We don't want to hurt you… much."
                    <br><br>
                    I swallowed hard, fear threatening to overwhelm me. But then I remembered Felix's sacrifice. I couldn't let it be in vain.
                    <br><br>
                    Focusing my energy, I lifted a nearby trash can and hurled it at the men. They dodged easily, but it bought me a moment to gather more power. I sent a wave of energy a them, knocking two off their feet.
                    <br><br>
                    But the third was quicker. He charged at me, a strange device in his hand. As he got closer, I felt my energy draining. An energy absorber, I realized with horror.
                    <br><br>
                    I managed to sidestep his lunge, but I knew I couldn't keep this up forever. My training hadn't prepared me for a real fight like this.
                    <br><br>
                    Just as despair began to set it, I remembered something Felix had told me once. A technique called "Energy Blast". he had warned me it was dangerous, that I wasn't ready. But what choice did I have?
                    <br><br>
                    I began to concentrate, drawing on every ounce of energy I have.
                    <br><br>
                    "What's he doing?" one of them shouted, with a slight panic in his voice.
                    <br><br>
                    I didn't give them time to react. With a primal scream, I released all the energy at once. A blinding light erupted from my hands, engulfing everything around me.
                    <br><br>
                    The last thing I heard was the men's screams before the world went white.</p>
