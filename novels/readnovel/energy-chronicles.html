                <p>
                             I often wonder if my life would have been different if I hadn’t loved my grandfather so much. Maybe if I’d been a more distant child, less attached to the old man who filled my days with joy, I wouldn’t have ended up where I am now. But that’s not who I was. I was Leo Silva, a boy who thought his grandfather hung the moon and stars.
                    <br><br>
                    It was April 2032, and spring was in full bloom in our neighbourhood. Trees painted the streets green, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of new beginnings. But for me, it was the beginning of the end.
                    <br><br>
                    I remember that morning as if it was yesterday. The sun had barely peeked over the horizon when I heard my mother’s scream.
                    <br><br>
                    I was just five at that time.
                    <br><br>
                    The scream tore through the house. I got out of my bed, my heart pounding in my chest.
                    <br><br>
                    “Father! Father, please wake up!”
                    <br><br>
                    Her voice was full of desperation. I ran towards my grandfather’s room. The door was wide open, and I could see my mother hunched over the bed, shaking the still form of my grandfather.
                    <br><br>
                    “Grandpa?” I called out.
                    <br><br>
                    My mother turned to me, her eyes full of tears. 
                    <br><br>
                    “Go back to your room, Now!” she said, but I couldn’t move. My eyes were fixed on my grandfather’s face.
                    <br><br>
                    He looked… peaceful. Like he was just sleeping. I didn’t understand what happened to him at that time.
                    <br><br>
                    “Is Grandpa okay?” I asked with my innocent voice.
                    <br><br>
                    My mother came to me. She kneed down and hugged me. “Grandpa… Grandpa has gone to sleep… and… and he won’t wake up.” 
                    <br><br>
                    I didn’t understand. How could someone sleep and never wake up? It didn’t make sense.
                    <br><br>
                    Then, the innocent child spoke.
                    <br><br>
                    “But… but he promised to take me to the park today…”
                    <br><br>
                    Those words hit my mother hard. She held me tighter, her body shaking. “I’m so sorry, sweetheart… I’m so, so sorry.”
                    <br><br>
                    The time flew within the next few hours: people came and went, police officers, doctor, some relatives whom I had never met. They spoke among themselves in hushed tones, treating me with sympathetic eyes. I, however, was too distracted to pay attention to all that; my mind was with my grandfather.
                    <br><br>
                    He was more that a grandfather to me. He was my best friend, my personal hero. He always had time for me, always had a story to tell or a game to play. He would sit me on his knee and tell me about his work. I didn’t understand most of it, but I loved the way his eyes would light up when he talked about science and things I couldn’t even pronounce.
                    <br><br>
                    As the day goes on, the reality of what had happened began to sink in. 
                    <br><br>
                    Grandpa was gone. 
                    <br><br>
                    He wouldn’t be there to tuck me in at night, to chase the monsters under my bed. He wouldn’t be there to teach me how to ride a bike or to cheer me on my first school day. The weight of his loss pressed down on me, making it hard to breathe.
                    <br><br>
                    That night, as I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, I felt something inside me break. The world suddenly seemed too big, too scary without my grandfather in it. 
                    <br><br>
                    I closed my eyes, wishing that when I open my eyes, this would all be a bad dream. That Grandpa would be there, smiling and ready to take me to the park.
                    <br><br>
                    But when I opened my eyes, nothing had changed. The world was still empty, still wrong. I felt myself slipping away. It was easier than facing a world without Grandpa. Easier than trying to understand why he had left me.
                    All I knew was that I wanted to sleep. To escape. And so I did, slipping into a deep void that would hold me for far longer than anyone could expect.

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>
                             I opened my eyes and started blinking because the bright light bothered my eyes. Everything around was some kind of white blur; there were some beeping sounds. When my sight began to clear up, I realized I was lying in the hospital bed with some weird machines around me.
                    <br><br>
                    “He’s awake!” a voice exclaimed.
                    <br><br>
                    I tried to speak, but my throat was dry. A nurse showed up by my side, helping me to sit and offering me a glass of water. As I took a sip of it, I noticed how weak my arms felt, how difficult it was to hold the glass steady.
                    <br><br>
                    “Leo”, a doctor called my name, his face was a mix of relief and concern. “How are you feeling?”
                    <br><br>
                    I opened my mouth to speak, but I was startled when I saw my reflection in the window behind him. The face staring back at me wasn’t the one I remember. It was older, sharper.
                    <br><br>
                    “Wh- what happened to me?”
                    <br><br>
                    The doctor and nurse stared at each other, a silent conversation between them. Finally, the doctor took a deep breath and said: “Leo… You’ve been asleep for twelve years.”
                    <br><br>
                    What did he say? Twelve years? Is this some kind of a joke? It couldn’t be possible. The last thing I remember was…
                    <br><br>
                    Suddenly, memories came back to me. My grandfather, found dead in his bed. The grief and depression that overwhelmed me.
                    <br><br>
                    And then… nothing.
                    <br><br>
                    “Your family is here” the nurse said, interrupting my thoughts. “They’ve been waiting for you to wake up. Would you like to see them?”
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, still trying to process what have been said to me. Moments later, the door opened, and familiar yet odd faces rushed in. My mother, with streaks of grey in her hair. My father, whose hair was completely white, and his eyes were small and tired. And a girl I didn’t recognize at all.
                    <br><br>
                    She was a young teenager.
                    <br><br>
                    “Leo!” my mother cried, tears running down her face as she hugged me. It was warm.
                    <br><br>
                    “I can’t believe you’re awake, son” my father said, like someone who found his missing thing.
                    <br><br>
                    Well, I was missing from their life for over a decade.
                    <br><br>
                    My mother still hugging me, I saw that girl again. She stood awkwardly at the end of the bed, her eyes filled with tears.
                    <br><br>
                    Suddenly, I noticed some features of my baby sister in her.
                    <br><br>
                    “Yuki?” I said with a low voice.
                    <br><br>
                    She nodded with a smile and a face full of tears. “Yes… It’s me Yuki… It’s me, your sister.”
                    <br><br>
                    My family surrounded me, full of joy and relief, but I felt overwhelmed. Twelve years had passed, that’s a lot, the world had moved on while I was sleeping. I had so much to catch up to, so much to learn.

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>
                             The next two months were full of therapy sessions, medical tests, and attempts to catch up on the twelve years I lost. It was exhausting, both physically and mentally.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, the day came when I was discharged from the hospital. As we drove home, I pressed my face against the car window, looking at the city that changed a lot. There were buildings that looked futuristic. Holographic ads floated in the air, and people walked by with devices attached to their wrists rather that the phones I recall when I was little.
                    <br><br>
                    “It’s a lot, isn’t it?” my father said, noticing my wide eyes. I nodded.
                    <br><br>
                    “What year we’re in now?” I asked, still amazed by what I saw. “It’s 2044,” Yuki answered.
                    <br><br>
                    When we arrived home, I was shocked again. Our house that I remember had been replaced by a new one. Not the house itself, but what’s inside of it. It looked a bit more futuristic.
                    <br><br>
                    “Your room is upstairs…” my mother said. “We’ve kept it… well, we’ve tried to keep it as you left it.”
                    <br><br>
                    I entered my room, it was just the same as I remember it. My old drawings still on the walls, my books still on the shelf. But there was also a device on my desk, It didn’t look like a computer at all, it was some different.
                    <br><br>
                    “We thought you might want to catch up on things” Yuki said, stepping into the room behind me. She walked to that device on the desk. “This is is the new generation of computers,” She said while turning it on, a hologram appeared. 
                    <br><br>
                    “It doesn’t require a screen or a mouse or a keyboard either, you just put on this on your wrist and control it with your brain”
                    <br><br>
                    I was shocked, Technology advanced this much in just twelve years, I remember computer setups required a lot space and components, but now it’s just a rod connected to the power outlet, and a thing that you put on your wrist connected to it.
                    <br><br>
                    Man… That’s too much…
                    <br><br>
                    Yuki started showing me what I needed to learn to catch up, it was a long list, very long list.
                    <br><br>
                    “It’s… a lot…” I admitted.
                    <br><br>
                    Yuki smiled. “Take it one day at a time, there is no rush, take your time.”
                    <br><br>
                    It looked like Yuki knows so much about technology, even though she’s still 12.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the next few weeks, I was learning. I didn’t knew the world could advance so much in twelve years. Clean energy had replaced fossil fuels, medical breakthroughs for several diseases, and all sorts of discoveries in physiques, chemistry and biology.
                    <br><br>
                    But something felt wrong, something that isn’t in its place. All I remember before the coma about my grandfather’s death felt… like it wasn’t right. Why had that event affected me so much? And why do I feel that there is more to the story?

            <h1 class="title">Chapter III <br><span>( Chapter 3 )</span></h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>	         It was a quiet evening, about a month after I had returned home. I was in my room, doing some maths problems on the computer, trying to solve them as quickly as possible. I got tired, and I decided to take a break.
                    <br><br>
                    As I made my way downstairs for a snack, I heard the clatter of the mail slot. Curious, I went to check it out. Among the usual bills and ads, there was a plain white envelope. It was addressed simply to “Leo Silva”, with nothing else.
                    <br><br>
                    Who could be writing to me? Everyone I knew was aware that I had just woken up. I got back to my room and carefully opened the envelope.
                    <br><br>
                    Inside was a single sheet of paper with a message:
                    <br><br>
                    <i>“ Dear Leo,<br><br>
                                       If you want to know the truth, come to the abandoned Luminari High School today at midnight. <br><br> Alone.”</i>
                    <br><br>
                    I read the message once, twice. No, I read it multiple times, making sure I’m reading it correctly.
                    <br><br>
                    The Truth? What truth? And why meet at an abandoned school in the middle of the night?
                    <br><br>
                    Part of me knew it was ridiculous to even consider going. It could be a dangerous trap, or just some stupid prank. But another part of me knew that I need to go, I need to check what is it. It was burning with curiosity.
                    <br><br>
                    I spent the rest of the day distracted, barely able to focus on my studies. At dinner, I pushed my food around the plate, lost in thoughts.
                    <br><br>
                    “Leo? Are you feeling alright?” my mother asked with concern.
                    <br><br>
                    I forced a smile. 
                    <br><br>
                    “Just tired, I guess.”
                    <br><br>
                    As the night fell, I made my decision. I had to know what this was about. I waited until I was sure everyone else was asleep, then quietly made my way downstairs. 
                    <br><br>
                    I left a note saying I had gone for a walk, just in case anyone woke up and found me missing.
                    <br><br>
                    And then, I got out.</p>

                <p>
                             The night air was cold. My heart pounding faster with each moment, a mix of fear and excitement. The letter I received earlier that day was still in my mind.
                    <br><br>
                    To be honest, I had a thought that I was walking into a trap, or some kind of a prank, but the curiosity to know was too strong.
                    <br><br>
                    When I got closer to the school, it seemed to me that it was not alive any more which reached its dying days – the building was broken and pale in front of the starry night. The gate to the area was locked, so I had to look for a place to hop over the fence that enclosed the compound. Upon touching the ground on the other side, I inhaled deeply as I prepared for whatever was waiting for me next.
                    <br><br>
                    The corridors were uncomfortably silent as I made my way through the abandoned building. Moonlight coming through the broken windows, casting long shadows which made the place even scarier.To make it even worse, the floor creaked as I walked. 
                    <br><br>
                    This is hell!
                    <br><br>
                    Suddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. My heart was rushing, and without thinking, I started running as fast as I could. The footsteps were getting closer. I was in such panic I realized I didn’t know where I was going.
                    <br><br>
                    I spotted a door with a faint light coming from underneath. It was my only option. I sprinted towards it, opened it, and slammed it shut behind me. I leaned against the door trying to catch my breath.
                    <br><br>
                    I found myself at the top of staircase. The source of the light was coming from below. I began to descend slowly, careful with each step.
                    <br><br>
                    At the bottom, I saw another door. This one was different - it looked like a lab door rather than a school one. I reached for the handle, but it was stuck. No matter how hard I pushed or pulled, it wouldn’t budge.
                    <br><br>
                    Exhausted, I sat on the floor. What was I even doing here? This whole situation seemed insane. As I sat there, thinking of what should I do next, I heard a click.
                    <br><br>
                    The door slowly swung open.

                             My breath caught in my throat as the door revealed a tall man, probably in his fifties. His face was aged and worried, but his eyes tell a different story.
                    <br><br>
                    “Leo,” he said. “I’ve been waiting for you. Please, come in.”
                    <br><br>
                    I hesitated at first, but I had come this far, and the promise of answers was too tempting to resist. Swallowing my fear, I stepped in.
                    <br><br>
                    The room was filled with equipments I couldn’t even begin to understand. Computers, strange devices blinking. The man led me to a chair, and I sat down, my legs feeling weak.
                    <br><br>
                    “My name in Felix” he began. “I was your grandfather’s research partner.”
                    <br><br>
                    My eyes widened. “You know my grandfather?”
                    <br><br>
                    Felix nodded with a sad smile on his face. “He was a brilliant man, and a good friend. But his brilliance… it got him killed.”
                    <br><br>
                    “What do you mean by killed?! ”
                    <br><br>
                    “Your grandfather was murdered while he was asleep by a secret organization called Kagami. They wanted his research, but he refused to give it to them. You see, Sato had discovered something incredible - something that could change the world. But in the wrong hands, it could be catastrophic.”
                    <br><br>
                    As Felix spoke, I felt myself sinking. My grandfather, murdered? A secret organization? It all seemed too fantastical to be true. And yet, deep down, I knew he was telling the truth.
                    <br><br>
                    “But what does this have to do with me?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.
                    <br><br>
                    “Before your grandfather died, he did something… unprecedented. He injected you with a chemical compound that altered your DNA. He believed that if anyone could control what I’m about to show you, it would be you, Leo.”
                    <br><br>
                    My head was spinning. I had so many questions, but before I could even speak, Felix stood and walked over to a nearby table. He pressed a button, and a hologram appeared on top of it.
                    <br><br>
                    It was a bracelet, sleek and futuristic. I stared at it, mesmerized.
                    <br><br>
                    “This” Felix said, “is what your grandfather gave his life for.”

                <p>
                             I couldn’t take my eyes off the holographic bracelet floating in front of me. It seemed to pulse with an energy of its own, drawing me in like a mosquito to a light bulb.
                    <br><br>
                    “What… what is this?” I asked.
                    <br><br>
                    “This bracelet is the culmination of your grandfather’s life’s work. When implanted in a host body, it allows them to focus their energy and transform it into almost anything.”
                    <br><br>
                    I blinked, trying to process his words. “Transform energy into… anything? How is that even possible?”
                    <br><br>
                    “It’s based on the Theory of Relativity and Quantum physics,” Felix continued. “The bracelet draws energy from the body and convert it into matter. Your grandfather believed that with the right host - someone with the ability to store and control vast amounts of energy - the possibilities would be limitless.”
                    <br><br>
                    My mind was reeling. It all sounded like something out of a science fiction novel. And yet, as I looked at the hologram, I noticed a strange feeling within me, as if some part of me recognized the truth in Felix’s words.
                    <br><br>
                    “And you think I’m this… host?” I asked.
                    <br><br>
                    Felix nodded. “Your grandfather altered your DNA for this very purpose, Leo. Your body can store and manipulate energy in ways that no one else can. But it’s not just about the bracelet anymore. Kagami knows you’re awake now, and they want more than just the device. They want you.”
                    <br><br>
                    A chill ran down my spine at his words. The weight of responsibility settled on my shoulders, heavy and suffocating. I thought of my family, unaware of the danger lurking in the shadows. Of the world I had just reawakened to, still so new and unfamiliar.
                    <br><br>
                    “What… what do you want me to do?” I asked, though I already knew the answer.
                    <br><br>
                    “I want you to continue your grandfather’s work, Leo. To master the bracelet’s power and use it to stop Kagami. It won’t be easy. The risks are enormous, possibly even fatal. But you might be our only hope.”
                    <br><br>
                    That’s too much responsibility. What should I do? Decline the offer and continue to live a normal life? Or accept it for my grandfather’s trust in me?

                <p>
                             I stood there, my heart pounding in my chest as I looked at Felix. The bracelet project, my grandfather’s legacy, and the key to unlock unimaginable power - it was all real, and it was right in front of me.
                    <br><br>
                    “So, Leo,” Felix’s voice cut through my thoughts, “what do you say? Are you willing to take on this responsibility?”
                    <br><br>
                    I swallowed hard, my mind racing. On one hand, the idea of having such incredible abilities was exhilarating. On the other hand, the dangers were clear. Kagami was after me, and this bracelet could change my life forever - for better or worse.
                    <br><br>
                    “What are the risks?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.
                    <br><br>
                    “The implantation process is delicate. There’s a chance of rejection, and in the worst case… it could be fatal.”
                    <br><br>
                    I felt a chill run down my spine. Fatal?! That’s the last word I wanted to hear. But then I thought of my grandfather, of his dedication to this project, and the threat Kagami posed on the world.
                    <br><br>
                    Taking a deep breath, I looked Felix in the eyes. “I’ll do it.”
                    <br><br>
                    A mix of relief and concern appeared on Felix’s face. He nodded  and gestured for me to follow him. “Then let’s begin.”
                    <br><br>
                    As he led me to a small room where the implantation would take place, I couldn’t help but feel a mix of fear and excitement. In just a few short hours, my life had changed forever.
                    <br><br>
                    And as I lay on the operating table, watching Felix prepare for the procedure, I knew that nothing would ever be the same again.

                <p>
                             The walk home from the lab was a blur. My head spinning from everything that had happened. As I approached my house, a new challenge presented itself: how was I going to explain all of this to my family?
                    <br><br>
                    I stopped at the front door, taking a deep breath to compose myself. The bandage on my arm felt conspicuous. With a sigh, I pushed the door open.
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m home!” I called out.
                    <br><br>
                    My mother’s voice coming from the kitchen. “Leo? Where have you been? I was worried!”
                    <br><br>
                    I stepped into the kitchen, where my parents and sister Yuki were gathered. Their eyes immediately zeroed in on my bandaged arm.
                    <br><br>
                    “What happened?” my father asked with concern.
                    <br><br>
                    I smiled nervously. “I, uh, had a bit of an accident while walking down the street. Tripped and fell on my arm. The doctor said it’s just a sprain, nothing serious.” 
                    <br><br>
                    My mother rushed over, fussing over my arm. “Oh, sweetie! You need to be more careful.”
                    <br><br>
                    As she examined the bandaged, I felt a pang of guilt. I hated lying to them, but I knew it was necessary. How could I possibly explain the truth?
                    <br><br>
                    Yuki, however, was looking at me suspiciously. “What did you even go walking at night? Isn’t that very dangerous.   ”
                    <br><br>
                    I swallowed hard, searching for a believable answer. “I… I just couldn’t sleep and needed something to do. So, I went for a walk.”
                    <br><br>
                    Yuki didn’t look entirely convinced, but she didn’t press further. As my family continued to fuss over me, I couldn’t help but feel the weight of my secret pressing down on me. This was just the beginning, I realized. From now on, I would have to live a double life, constantly balancing between the truth and the lies I’d have to tell to protect it.
                    <br><br>
                    That night, as I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, I wondered if I had made the right choice. The path ahead was fraught with danger and deception. But as I thought of the power growing within me and the threat of Kagami looming over the world, I knew there was no turning back now. Whatever challenges lay ahead, I would face them head-on.

                <p>
                             After two months of the surgery, I returned back to Felix’s lab to continue what I had started. I knew that the real challenge was just beginning. I stood there, in the center of the lab, my arm still bandaged and sore from the implantation.
                    <br><br>
                    “Alright, Leo” Felix said, coming to a stop in front of me. “It’s time to see what you can do.”
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, trying to ignore the nervousness in my stomach.
                    <br><br>
                    He pointed to a small pencil on a nearby table. “Start simple. Try to move that pencil without touching it.”
                    <br><br>
                    I focused on the pencil, willing it to move. 
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing happened. 
                    <br><br>
                    I furrowed my brow, concentrating harder.
                    <br><br>
                    Still nothing.
                    <br><br>
                    “Remember, the bracelet channels your energy. You need to feel it flowing through you, then direct it towards the pencil.”
                    <br><br>
                    I closed my eyes, trying to sense this energy Felix spoke of. At first, there was nothing. Then, slowly, I became aware of a warn sensation in arm, right where the bracelet was implanted. I focused on that feeling, imaging it spreading through my body and extending towards the pencil.
                    <br><br>
                    When I opened my eyes, the pencil was vibrating slightly. I felt a surge of excitement going through me, and for a moment, the pencil lifted a fraction of an inch off the table before falling back down.
                    <br><br>
                    Exhaustion hit me like a wave, and I stumbled back, catching myself on a nearby chair.
                    <br><br>
                    Felix’s hand was on my shoulder, steadying me. “Well done, Leo. That’s enough for today.”
                    <br><br>
                    As I caught my breath, a small smile crept onto my face. It wasn’t much, but it was a start. And for the first time since waking up, I felt a glimmer of hope for the future.

                             As I stood there in the dimly lit laboratory, sweat beading on my brow, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. It had been weeks since I first attempted to move objects with my mind, and now, finally, I was seeing real progress.
                    <br><br>
                    "Excellent work, Leo" Felix said with a wide smile on face. 'You're progressing faster than I anticipated.'
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, trying to hide my exhaustion. "Thank you, Mr. Felix. But I still have a long way to go, don't I?"
                    <br><br>
                    He chuckled. "Indeed. Moving small objects is just the beginning. Soon, we'll move on to more complex manipulations."
                    <br><br>
                    I flexed my fingers, feeling the strange tingle of energy coursing through them. The bracelet hidden beneath my skin pulsed with each heartbeat, always reminding me of the power - and responsibility - I now carried.
                    <br><br>
                    "Mr. Felix" I began hesitantly, "do you really think I can master all of this power? It… It seems impossible."
                    <br><br>
                    "Leo, your grandfather believed in you. He saw potential in you that you can't yet see in yourself. Trust in that."
                    <br><br>
                    With those words, I felt a surge of determination. I may have lost twelve years of my life, but I wouldn't waste a single moment more. I had to become stronger, to understand this power, to protect those I cared about from the shadows that lurked in the corners of this world.
                    <br><br>
                    I straightened my back, "Let's continue. I'm ready for the next challenge."
                    <br><br>
                    Felix nodded approvingly. "Very well. Let's see how you can handle multiple objects at once."
                    <br><br>
                    As the training continues, I felt a mix of accomplishment and concern. Even though I just started, I felt that I had a very long way to go. And who knows when will Kagami find us.

                <p>         The rough texture of the stone grated against my palm as I concentrated, willing the jagged rock to change shape. Sweat dripped down my face, my jaw clenched in determination. Slowly, agonizingly, the edges began to smooth out, the rock morphing into a perfect sphere.
                    <br><br>
                    "Well done." Felix's voice broke through my intense focus. "You're making remarkable progress with solid manipulation."
                    <br><br>
                    I let out a breath, the stone sphere dropping into my hand. "Thank you, Mr. Felix. But it's still so difficult. Every different material requires a unique approach."
                    <br><br>
                    He nodded sagely. "That's the nature of energy manipulation. Each element, each state of matter, has its own… personality, if you will. You must learn to communicate with it, to understand its essence."
                    <br><br>
                    I turned the stone over in my hand, fascinated at its perfectly smooth surface. It was hard to believe that just a month ago, I could barely lift a pencil. Now, I was reshaping matter itself. The progress was exhilarating, but also terrifying. With each new skill I mastered, the weight of responsibility grew heavier.
                    <br><br>
                    But something was concerning me. "Mr. Felix, what if Kagami finds out about my training? What if they come after my family?"
                    <br><br>
                    "That's precisely why we must continue, Leo. The stronger you become, the better equipped you'll be to protect those you love."
                    <br><br>
                    I thought of my parents, of my sister Yuki. They had no idea of the danger that lurked in the shadows, of the power that now coursed through my veins. I had to become stronger, for their sake.
                    <br><br>
                    "Let's continue" I said, setting the stone sphere aside. "What's next?"
                    <br><br>
                    Felix smiled. "I think it's time we move on to something a bit more… challenging. Tell me, Leo, how do you feel about working with metal?"
                    <br><br>
                    As I saw the shining ingot of steel in front of me, I knew I had a long way to go. But with each challenge overcome, with each new skill mastered, I was one step closer to becoming the protector my family -and the world- needed me to be.</p>

                <p>         The gentle breeze caressed my face as I stood in the open field behind the abandoned school. It was refreshing to get out of Felix's lab to train once in a while.
                    <br><br>
                    "Remember, Leo. Gases are not just about force. It's about finesse, about understanding the currents and flows that exist all around us."
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, closing my eyes and extending my senses. The bracelet hummed beneath my skin, resonating with the energy that permeated the air. Slowly, carefully, I began to exert my will upon the invisible currents.

                    At first, nothing seemed to happen. Then, gradually, I felt the air around me shift and change. A small whirlwind formed at my feet, kicking up dust and leaves. Encouraged, I pushed harder, willing the vortex to grow.
                    <br><br>
                    The wind picked up speed, howling around me. Leaves and small branches were torn from nearby trees, caught in the maelstrom of my creation. For a moment, I felt a surge of elation at my success.
                    <br><br>
                    Then, suddenly, it all spiralled out of control.
                    <br><br>
                    The whirlwind expanded rapidly, growing far beyond what I had intended. I could hear Felix shouting something, but his words were lost in the roar of the wind. Panic gripped me as I realized I couldn't stop what I had started.
                    <br><br>
                    "Focus, Leo!" I finally managed to hear Felix. "Don't fight it. Guide it!"
                    <br><br>
                    I took a deep breath, centering myself. Instead of trying to forcefully stop the whirlwind, I visualized its energy, its flow. Gradually, I began to guide it, like a shepherd herding an unruly flock.
                    <br><br>
                    Slowly, agonizingly, the wind began to calm. The vortex shrank, the howling died down to a whisper, and finally, all was still.
                    <br><br>
                    I opened my eyes, panting heavily. The field around us was a mess of scattered leaves and broken branches. Felix stood a short distance away, his hair and clothes dishevelled but a proud smile on his face.
                    <br><br>
                    "An excellent lesson," he said, approaching me. "You've learned first-hand both the power and danger of gas manipulation."
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, still catching my breath. "I… I lost control. It was terrifying."
                    <br><br>
                    As we walked back to the lab, discussing the finer points of my performance, I couldn't shake the lingering sense of unease. The power I was learning to wield was immense, capable of great good but also terrible destruction. The responsibility was heavy.
                    <br><br>
                    But as I thought of my family, of the threat that Kagami posed to everything I held dear, I knew I had no choice but to continue. I had to master this power, to become strong enough to protect those I loved.
                    <br><br>
                    The wind had changed, and I had to change with it.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>         As I stood by the edge of a small pond near Felix's lab, I took a deep breath and focused my energy. The task in front of me seemed impossible - controlling liquids. After mastering solids and gases, I thought this would be easier, but I was sorely mistaken.
                    <br><br>
                    "Remember, Leo" Felix said from behind, "water is alive. It flows, it adapts. You must become one with it."
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, extending my hand towards the pond's surface. Concentrating hard, I tried to lift a small column of water. At first, nothing happened. Then, ever so slowly, a thin stream began to rise.
                    <br><br>
                    "That's it!" Felix exclaimed. "Now, try to shape it."
                    <br><br>
                    As soon as I attempted to mold the water, it collapsed, splashing back into the pond. I gritted my teeth in frustration.
                    <br><br>
                    "This is impossible." I said.
                    <br><br>
                    Felix placed a hand on my shoulder. "Nothing is impossible, Leo. Your grandfather believed in you. I believe in you. Now, try again."
                    <br><br>
                    Taking another deep breath, I reached out once more. This time, I imagined the water as an extension of myself. To my surprise, a larger column rose from the pond. Carefully, I began to shape it into a sphere.
                    <br><br>
                    "Excellent!" Felix cheered.
                    <br><br>
                    Just as I was about to celebrate my success, the sphere burst, drenching me from head to toe. Felix couldn't help but laugh, and soon, I found myself joining in.
                    <br><br>
                    "Well," I said, wiping water from my eyes, "at least I'm staying hydrated."</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>         Weeks had passed since I began my training with liquids, and while I had made progress, I was eager to move on to the next challenge - plasma manipulation. As Felix led me to a specially prepared area of the lab, I could feel my heart racing with excitement and apprehension.
                    <br><br>
                    "Now, Leo," Felix began, his voice serious, "plasma is the most dangerous state of matter we've worked with so far. It's unpredictable, volatile, and incredibly hot. We'll start with something simple - a small flame."
                    <br><br>
                    He lit a candle and placed it in front of me. "Try to control it, make it dance to your will."
                    <br><br>
                    I focused on the tiny flame, reaching out with my energy. At first, nothing happened. Then, slowly, the flame began to flicker and sway in response to my commands.
                    <br><br>
                    "Good." Felix nodded. "Now, try to make it grow."
                    <br><br>
                    Concentrating harder, I poured more energy into the flame. Suddenly, it erupted into a pillar of fire, nearly singeing my eyebrows. I stumbled back, startled by the intensity.
                    <br><br>
                    "Careful!" Felix warned, quickly extinguishing the flame. "Too much energy, too fast. You must learn to control the flow precisely."
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, felling embarrassed. "Let's try again."
                    <br><br>
                    For hours, we worked on controlling flames of various sizes. By the end of the session, I was exhausted and exhilarated. I had managed to create and manipulate plasma with a level of control I never thought possible.
                    <br><br>
                    As we finished for the day, Felix looked at me with a mixture of pride and concern. "You're progressing faster than I anticipated, Leo. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. We must be cautious."
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, understanding the weight of his words. Little did I know how foreshadowing they would prove to be.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>         As weeks turned into months, my training intensified. I was now to manipulate all four states of matter with increasing proficiency. However, with each passing day, I could sense a growing tension in Felix.
                    <br><br>
                    One evening, as we concluded our training session, Felix motioned for me to sit. I could clearly see worry in his face.
                    <br><br>
                    "Leo…" he began with a low voice, "I've received more disturbing news about Kagami's activities. They're getting closer to discovering our location."
                    <br><br>
                    A chill ran down my spine. "What does this mean for us?"
                    <br><br>
                    Felix sighed heavily. "It means we need to accelerate your training. You're progressing well, but you're not ready to face them yet. And I fear we may not have as much time as we initially thought."
                    <br><br>
                    I clenched my fists. "What can we do?"
                    <br><br>
                    "We'll need to focus on combining your skills, creating more complex manipulations. And… we may need to consider offensive techniques." Felix explained.
                    <br><br>
                    The gravity of the situation hit me. Up until now, my training had been focused on control and manipulation. The idea of using these powers as weapons… it was both thrilling and terrifying.
                    <br><br>
                    "I understand, I'm ready for whatever comes next." I said.
                    <br><br>
                    Felix smiled sadly. "I hope you are, my boy. I truly hope you are."
                    <br><br>
                    As I left the lab that night, walking home under the light of the moon, I couldn't shake the feeling that my life was about to change drastically. The weight of responsibility settled heavily on my shoulders, and I knew that the peaceful days of my youth were coming to an end.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>         I woke up that morning with a strange feeling in my gut. Something was off, but I couldn't put my finger on it. As I made my way to the lab for another training session with Felix, the air felt heavy, charged with an invisible tension.
                    <br><br>
                    "Focus, Leo," Felix's voice cut through my thoughts. "Today, we're going to push your limits."
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, trying to shake off the unease. We had been training for months, and I had made significant progress in manipulating energy. But today, Felix seemed more intense than usual.
                    <br><br>
                    As I began concentrate, channelling energy through the bracelet embedded in my arm, a loud crash echoed through the lab. Felix and I exchanged alarmed glances.
                    <br><br>
                    "Kagami," he whispered, his face pale. "They've found us."
                    <br><br>
                    Before I could react, the door burst open. Men in black uniforms swarmed in, their eyes cold. I recognized the emblem on their jackets - Kagami, the organization that killed my grandfather.
                    <br><br>
                    "Leo, run!" Felix shouted, positioning himself between me and the intruders.
                    <br><br>
                    I hesitated, torn between fleeing and helping my mentor. But as the first blows were exchanged, I realized I was out of my depth. Felix moved with a grace I had never seen before, his firsts connecting with deadly precision.
                    <br><br>
                    "Go!" he yelled again. "You're the only one who can stop them now!"
                    <br><br>
                    With a heavy heart, I turned and ran towards the emergency exit. The sound of fighting faded behind me as I raced up the hidden staircase, my mind reeling. How had Kagami found us? What would happen to Felix?
                    <br><br>
                    As I emerged into the sunlight, gasping for air, I knew that my life would never be the same again.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>         My lungs burned as I ran through the streets, trying to put as much distance between myself and the lab as possible. But the sounds of pursuit were growing closer. I ducked into an alley, my heart pounding in my chest.
                    <br><br>
                    "There he is!" a gruff voice shouted.
                    <br><br>
                    They spotted me.
                    <br><br>
                    I turned to face my pursuers, my hand instinctively going to the bracelet in my arm. There were three of them, all armed and looking far more experienced than me.
                    <br><br>
                    "Surrender, boy," one of them growled. "We don't want to hurt you… much."
                    <br><br>
                    I swallowed hard, fear threatening to overwhelm me. But then I remembered Felix's sacrifice. I couldn't let it be in vain.
                    <br><br>
                    Focusing my energy, I lifted a nearby trash can and hurled it at the men. They dodged easily, but it bought me a moment to gather more power. I sent a wave of energy a them, knocking two off their feet.
                    <br><br>
                    But the third was quicker. He charged at me, a strange device in his hand. As he got closer, I felt my energy draining. An energy absorber, I realized with horror.
                    <br><br>
                    I managed to sidestep his lunge, but I knew I couldn't keep this up forever. My training hadn't prepared me for a real fight like this.
                    <br><br>
                    Just as despair began to set it, I remembered something Felix had told me once. A technique called "Energy Blast". he had warned me it was dangerous, that I wasn't ready. But what choice did I have?
                    <br><br>
                    I began to concentrate, drawing on every ounce of energy I have.
                    <br><br>
                    "What's he doing?" one of them shouted, with a slight panic in his voice.
                    <br><br>
                    I didn't give them time to react. With a primal scream, I released all the energy at once. A blinding light erupted from my hands, engulfing everything around me.
                    <br><br>
                    The last thing I heard was the men's screams before the world went white.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          When I regained consciousness, the world around me was unrecognizable. The alley where I had been cornered was gone, replaced by vast expanse of rubble and destruction. The air was thick with dust, making it hard to breathe.
                    <br><br>
                    I struggled to my feet, my entire body aching. What had happened? The Energy Blast… it must have been far more powerful than I thought.
                    <br><br>
                    As I walked through the ruins, the full extent of the damage became clear. Buildings in every direction had been destroyed, nothing left from them but jagged concrete and twisted metal. There was no sigh of the Kagami agents who had been following me, or of any other people for that matter.
                    <br><br>
                    A wave of nausea hit me as I realized everything. I had done this. In my desperation to survive, I unleashed a power I couldn't control, and the consequences were catastrophic.
                    <br><br>
                    "Hello?" I called out. "Is anyone there?"
                    <br><br>
                    Only silence answered me. Panic began to set in. How far had the blast reached? What about my family? Felix?
                    <br><br>
                    I began to run, ignoring the pain in my body. I had to find someone, anyone who could tell me what had happened. But as I moved through the devastated landscape, I saw no signs of life.
                    <br><br>
                    Hours passed, and the sun began to set on a world forever changed. I collapsed to my knees, overwhelmed by exhaustion and guilt.
                    <br><br>
                    "What have I done?" I whispered to the empty air.
                    <br><br>
                    As darkness fell, I made a promise to myself. I would find out the full extent of the damage I had caused. And somehow, someway, I would make things right. But first, I needed to survive in this new,  hostile world I had inadvertently created.
                    <br><br>
                    With a heavy heart, I picked myself up and began walking. The future was uncertain, but one thing was clear - nothing would ever be the same again.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          Days blended into each other as I wandered through the wasteland that had once been my home. It was hard to keep track of time. I survived on what little I could scavenge from the ruins, always on guard for the strange noises I could hear in the distance.
                    <br><br>
                    It was on what I estimated to be the fifth day when I saw them - the first signs of life since the catastrophe. At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. Three figures moved in the distance, their shapes distorted by the hazy air.
                    <br><br>
                    As I got closer, my breath caught in my throat. These are humans, three in fact, but something was strange. They weren't wearing the casual clothings of the time, instead, they were wearing animal skin and they had wooden and bone clubs and spears.
                    <br><br>
                    I hid behind a tree, observing them carefully. They appeared to be scavenging, just as I had been. Their movements were cautious, wary. I realized with a start that they were just as afraid as I was.
                    <br><br>
                    Gathering my courage, I stepped out from my hiding place. "Hello?" I called out.
                    <br><br>
                    The trio turned around, eyes wide with surprise and fear. One of them  stepped forward, with a spear in his hand. "Who are you?" he demanded. "Are you… are you human?"
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded slowly. "I think so. I… I don't know what happened to the world."
                    <br><br>
                    The three looked at each other. Another one of them came to me and spoke. "Are you sure you are human? Because there were some people that didn't look human at all. Like… like they were mutated."
                    <br><br>
                    What? Mutated people? How was this possible? Was that energy blast so powerful it changed the DNA of living beings? As if reading my thoughts, the third one spoke, "The Great Calamity changed everything. Some say it was a nuclear bomb. Others believe it was a failed experiment. But whatever it was, it remade the world and us with it."
                    <br><br>
                    The weight of guilt pressed down on me. The Great Calamity - that could only be my failed Energy Blast. I had not only destroyed the world I knew but had fundamentally altered the very nature of life itself.
                    <br><br>
                    "Come", the first one said. "It's not safe to wander in the open. We have a camp nearby. Perhaps you can tell us your story."
                    <br><br>
                    As I followed them, my mind raced. I had to find a way to undo this damage, to restore the world to what it once was. But first, I needed to understand this new reality I had created.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          The survivors' camp was a pitiful sight - a collection of ramshackle shelters cobbled together from the ruins of the old world. As we approached, I could see other people, all living in this post-apocalyptic hell I had caused.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the next few days, I learned more about the new world order. Those mutated people mentioned before had emerged in the aftermath of what they called the Great Calamity. Actually, the people in the camp once told me that they encountered a group of those mutated people, they didn't look harmful. They were similar to humans but shorter and had horns coming out of their head sides. Their leader was called… Harald Arf, and these mutated people formed a new race called "Arves'. I couldn't believe that my mistake would cause the formation of a whole new race, but if there is the Arves, I bet there is more.
                    <br><br>
                    As I sat by the communal fire one evening, picking at a meager meal of scavenged food, I couldn't shake the crushing guilt that weighed on me. These people, these new races - their entire existence was because of my mistake.
                    <br><br>
                    "You look troubled" a voice said behind me. I turned to see an elderly woman. "What burdens your heart, young one?"
                    <br><br>
                    I hesitated. How could I possibly explain? "I… I feel responsible," I finally said. "For all of this."
                    <br><br>
                    The old woman chuckled softly. "Many feel that way. The weight of survival is heavy. But we must move forward, mustn't we?"
                    <br><br>
                    Move forward… Yes, that's what I needed to do. I can't change the past, but perhaps I could work towards a better future.
                    <br><br>
                    That night, as I lay awake in my makeshift bed, a decision crystallized in my mind. Leo Silva, the boy who destroyed the world, needed to die. In his place, a new person would be born - someone dedicated to protecting this new world and its inhabitants.
                    <br><br>
                    The next morning, I approached the camp's leader, his name was Ghorn. "I've decided to leave," I told him. "To travel and see more of this new world."
                    <br><br>
                    Ghorn nodded approvingly. "A brave choice. What shall we call you, traveler?"
                    <br><br>
                    I thought for a moment, then spoke the name that had come to me in the night. "Junius" I said. "Junius Dordia."
                    <br><br>
                    "Very well, Junius Dordia" Ghorn rumbled. "May your journey be fruitful. And may you find what you seek."
                    <br><br>
                    As I set out from the camp, my meager possessions on my back and my broken bracelet hidden beneath my skin, I felt a sense of purpose I hadn't known since waking up in this ruined world. Junius Dordia would not run from the mistakes of the past. He would face them head-on and strive to make amends.
                    <br><br>
                    My journey through this transformed world was just beginning, and I had no idea what challenges lay ahead. But one thing was certain - I would do everything in my power to protect and nurture this new world, no matter the cost.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          The scorching sun beat down mercilessly on my back as I trudged through the endless sea of sand. The Great Desert of Akania stretched out in front of me, a vast, hostile expanse that seemed to mock my very existence.
                    <br><br>
                    As I walked, my hand unconsciously moved the the broken bracelet in my wrist. The device that once granted me incredible power now lay dormant. I had tried countless times to activate it, but to no avail. The bracelet remained stubbornly silent, its complex mechanisms as lifeless as the barren landscape around me.
                    <br><br>
                    "Water…" I croaked, my throat parched and dry. I reached for my canteen, only to find it empty. How long had I been walking? Days? Weeks? Time seemed to lose all meaning in this desolate place.
                    <br><br>
                    Suddenly, a movement caught my eye. Something was slithering beneath the sand, leaving a faint trail behind it. I tensed, my hand reaching for the makeshift spear I had made from scavenged materials.
                    <br><br>
                    The creature burst from the sand with frightening speed. It was like nothing I had ever seen before -  a monstrous hybrid of a scorpion and a snake, its body gleaming under the harsh sun. Its stinger-tipped tail lashed out at me, and I barely managed to dodge.
                    <br><br>
                    I rolled away as the creature's pincers snapped at the air where I had just been. This was one of the mutated animals that now roamed the world, twisted by the energy I had unleashed.
                    <br><br>
                    As I fought for my life against this desert abomination, I couldn't help but think of how far I had fallen. Once, I could have killed this creature with a mere thought, manipulating energy to my will. Now, I was reduced to scrambling in the sand, fighting with nothing but a crude spear and my wits.
                    <br><br>
                    The battle raged on, a desperate dance of survival under the unforgiving sun. With each near miss, with each close call, I was reminded of the harsh reality of this new world. A world I had created. A world I now had to survive.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="page" id="ch22">
            <h1 class="title">Chapter XXII <br><span>( Chapter 22 )</span></h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          Days turned into weeks as I traversed the seemingly endless desert. Each day brought new challenges, new horrors born from the remnants of the world I once knew. But with each challenge, I grew stronger, more adapted to this harsh new reality.
                    <br><br>
                    I learned to craft better tools from the scarce resources around me. My crude spear evolved into a more balanced weapon, its tip hardened by fire. I fashioned a water-catching device from scraps of cloth and metal, allowing me to collect the precious morning dew.
                    <br><br>
                    Food was scarce, but necessity taught me to look in unlikely places. Beneath certain rocks, I found pale, fat grubs that, while disgusting, provided much-needed protein. The rare desert plants I encountered became both food and medicine, their properties learned through careful experimentation and, sometimes, painful experience.
                    <br><br>
                    But perhaps the most significant change was in my fighting style. Without the bracelet's power, I had to rely on my own physical abilities. I practiced sword techniques I remembered from my training, adapting them to my spear. Hours were spent thrusting, parrying, and dodging imaginary opponents under the sun.
                    <br><br>
                    One particularly harsh day, as I was practicing my forms, I heard the sound of sand being displaced, probably by a subterranean predator. I readied my spear, my muscles tense but my mind calm.
                    <br><br>
                    The creature that emerged was similar to the scorpion-snake I had encountered earlier, but larger and more aggressive, its pincers snapped menacingly as it advanced.
                    <br><br>
                    This time, however, I was ready. When it attacked, I dodged. The creature's own momentum impaled it on my weapon. With a swift twist, I finished it off.
                    <br><br>
                    As I stood there, panting and covered in the creature's blood, I felt a mix of victory and sadness. I had survived, yes, but at what cost? How many more of these mutated beings would I have to kill? Beings that existed because of my actions?
                    <br><br>
                    I shook off these thoughts. There would be time for reflection later. For now, survival is the most important thing. I set about harvesting what I could from the creature's corpse - its chitin could be used to reinforce my makeshift armor, and its meat, while unappetizing, would keep me going for a few more days.
                    <br><br>
                    As night fell and I huddled in the meager shelter of a rock outcropping, I couldn't help but wonder: what other challenges awaited me beyond this desert? And more importantly, would I be ready to face them?</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          After what felt like an eternity, the endless expanse of sand finally gave way to something new. On the horizon, I could see a dark line slowly growing larger. As I approached, my heart raced with both excitement and apprehension. Trees. A forest. But not like any forest I had ever seen before.
                    <br><br>
                   The trees were massive, their trunks twisted and gnarled, their branches reaching up so high that they blotted out the sky. The canopy was so dense that little sunlight penetrated to the forest floor. It was as if night had fallen early, casting everything in a scary twilight.
                    <br><br>
                   I stood at the edge of this dark forest, torn between the relative familiarity of the desert behind me and the unknown dangers that surely lurked among the trees. But I knew I couldn't turn back. Whatever answers I sought, whatever redemption I hoped to find, it lay ahead, not behind.
                    <br><br>
                   Taking a deep breath, I stepped into the forest. The change was immediate and disorienting. The oppressive heat of the desert was replaced by a damp, cool air. The silence was profound, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves of the distant noise of some unknown creature.
                    <br><br>
                   As my eyes adjusted to the gloom, I began to notice unsettling details. The bark of the trees seemed to pulse with an inner light, faint veins of bioluminescence tracing patterns across their surfaces. Mushrooms of the size of small houses dotted the ground, their caps glowing with radiance.
                    <br><br>
                   I had only taken a few steps when I heard it - a low rumbling growl that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. I froze, my hand tightening on my spear. Something was out there, watching me.
                    <br><br>
                   Suddenly, a massive shape emerged from the shadows. It was a bear, or at least it had been once a bear. Now it was a nightmarish creature, its body covered in bony protrusions, its eyes glowing with an unnatural green light.
                    <br><br>
                   As the mutated bear charged towards me, I couldn't help but think that the challenges of the desert had been mere child's play compared to what this dark forest had in store for me. With my heart pounding and adrenaline surging through my veins, I raised my spear and prepared for the fight of my life.
                    <br><br>
                   The dark forest had welcomed me with open arms, and it seemed determined to never let me leave.</p>

        <div class="page" id="ch24">
            <h1 class="title">Chapter XXIV <br><span>( Chapter 24 )</span></h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          The battle with the mutated bear had left me battered and exhausted. My spear, which had served me so well in the desert, lay shattered beside the creature's massive corpse. I had won, but only just. As I leaned against a tree trying to catch my breath, I realized that I needed to adapt once again if I was to survive this environment.
                    <br><br>
                   Over the next few days, I crafted a new weapon from the bear's bones and sinew - a crude but effective sword. Its weight felt reassuring in my hand, a stark contrast to the constant unease that hung over my journey through this dark forest.
                    <br><br>
                   The  forest itself seemed alive, watching my every move with secret intents. The bioluminescent veins on the trees pulsed in irregular patterns, casting shadows that played tricks on my eyes. More than once, I found myself swinging at nothing, my nerves frayed by the constant state of alertness.
                    <br><br>
                   Food was plentiful here, but dangerous. The glowing mushrooms were tempting, but I had learned the hard way that some were highly toxic. Instead, I subsisted on the meat of smaller mutated creatures and the occasional edible plant that I recognized from my training with Felix.
                    <br><br>
                   Felix. The thought of my old mentor brought a pang of guilt and remorse. What would he think of me now, stumbling through this world of my own making? I pushed the thought aside. There was no returning to the past. I had to focus on survival.
                    <br><br>
                    As I got even deeper into the forest, the trees grew even larger, their trunks as wide as buildings. The canopy above became so thick that it was impossible to tell if it was day of night. Time lost all meaning in this perpetual twilight.
                    <br><br>
                   Just when I thought I couldn't take anymore, when the oppressive darkness and constant danger had pushed me to my limits, I saw it. A glimmer of light in the distance, steady and unwavering unlike the pulsing glow of the forest.
                    <br><br>
                   Hope surged through me, giving new strength to my tired limbs. I quickened my pace, my sword ready in case this was yet another trick of the forest. As I got closer, the light grew brighter, and I could make out the edge of the treeline.
                    <br><br>
                   With a final burst of speed, I broke through the last line of trees and found myself blinking in bright sunlight. As my eyes adjusted, I saw a sight that made my heart leap - a village in the distance, smoke rising from chimneys, the unmistakable signs of civilization.
                    <br><br>
                   For the first time since waking up in this changed world, I felt a glimmer of hope. Whatever challenges lay ahead, I was no longer alone. As I started walking towards the village, I couldn't help but wonder what kind of reception awaited me. Would these people be friends of foes?  And more importantly, would they have any answers about what had happened to the world?
                    <br><br>
                   With these thoughts in my mind, I took my first steps towards what I hoped would be a new chapter in my life.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          As I approached the village, my heart raced with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. The closer I got, the more details I could make out. The buildings were unlike anything I had seen before - a blend of primitive construction and modern style buildings. Houses were only built with clay or wood, but their style is modern.
                    <br><br>
                   But it was the inhabitants that truly caught my attention. They were humanoid, but definitely not human. Each person I could see had what looked like horns on their heads, each one of them had a unique size and color. I remembered the information that Ghorn had given me about the new races. These must be the Arves.
                    <br><br>
                   I hesitated at the outskirts of the village, suddenly very aware of how I must look - a ragged, wild-eyed stranger emerging from the dark forest. Before I could decide on my next move, a voice called out.
                    <br><br>
                   "Hey, you there! Are you lost?"
                    <br><br>
                   I turned to see a muscular man with small antlers coming out from his forehead approaching me.
                    <br><br>
                   "I… yes, I suppose I am." I replied, my voice rough from disuse. "My name is Junius. I've been traveling for a long time."
                    <br><br>
                   "I'm Paul. You look like you've been through hell, friend. Come on, let's get you some food and water."
                    <br><br>
                   Paul led me into the village, and I couldn't help but stare at everything around me. The Arves went about their daily lives, some pausing to glance curiously at me. Children played in the streets, their laughter a sound I hadn't heard in what felt like ages.
                    <br><br>
                   We arrived at what appeared to be a communal dining hall. The smell of food made my stomach growl embarrassingly loud. Paul laughed and motioned for me to sit at one of the tables.
                    <br><br>
                   "Wait here, I'll get you something to eat." he said, disappearing into what I assumed was the kitchen.
                    <br><br>
                   As I waited, I tried to process everything I was seeing. This village, these people - they were proof that life had not only survived the catastrophe I had caused but had adapted and thrived. The guilt that had been my constant companion since waking up in this new world twisted in my gut.
                    <br><br>
                   Paul returned with a steaming bowl of stew and a chunk of bread. As I ate, he asked me questions about where I had come from and what I had seen in my travels. I answered as truthfully as I could without revealing too much about my true identity or the role I had played in shaping this world.
                    <br><br>
                   "You know," Paul said thoughtfully, "we could use someone like you in the village. Someone who knows how to survive out there. Have you ever considered becoming an adventurer?"
                    <br><br>
                   I paused mid-bite. "An adventurer?"
                    <br><br>
                   Paul nodded enthusiastically. "Yeah, we have a guild here. Adventurers take on various tasks - exploring, monster hunting, escorting merchants. It's dangerous work, but the pay is good."
                    <br><br>
                   The idea was tempting. It would give me a purpose, a way to learn more about this new world, and perhaps even a chance to atone for my past actions.
                    <br><br>
                   "I… I think I'd like that." I finally said.
                    <br><br>
                   Paul grinned. "Great! I'll introduce you to Talhand tomorrow. He's the guild master and our main instructor. But for now, let's find you a place to rest. You look like you could use a good night's sleep."
                    <br><br>
                   As I followed Paul out of the dining hall, I felt a strange mix of emotions. Relief at finding a safe haven, excitement about this new opportunity, and an undercurrent of anxiety about what the future might hold. But for the first time since waking up in this changed world, I felt something else too - a sense of belonging.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          The next morning, Paul led me to a large building in the center of the village. A sign above the door proclaimed it to be the "Adventurers' Guild". as we entered, I was struck by the bustling activity inside. Arves of all shapes and sizes milled about, some poring over what looked like quest boards, others engaged in animated discussions about their recent exploits.
                    <br><br>
                    "Talhand!" Paul called out, waving to a muscular Arf with impressive ram-like horns. "I've got a new recruit for you!"
                    <br><br>
                    Talhand turned, his keen eyes appraising me. "Is that so?" he rumbled. "And what makes you think you've got what it takes to be an adventurer, boy?"
                    <br><br>
                    I straightened my back, meeting his gaze. "I've been traveling for almost a year and I came from that giant forest behind the village." I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "I may not know much about this world, but I know how to stay alive in it."
                    <br><br>
                    Talhand's eyebrows shot up. "The forest behind the village? You mean The Dark Forest? Hmm… not many make it out of there alive." He stroked his beard thoughtfully. "Alright, let's see what you can do. Follow me."
                    <br><br>
                    He led me to a trainini area behind the guild. Various weapons were arranged on racks along the walls, and training dummies were set up in one corner.
                    <br><br>
                    "Choose you weapon." Talhand instructed.
                    <br><br>
                    I walked over to the weapon racks, my eyes scanning over the various options. Swords, axes, spears, bows - they had everything. My hovered over a spear similar to the one I had before it broke, but then my eyes landed on something else. A sword, it had a simple design yet it was nothing like the sword I had crafted in the forest. It was better.
                    <br><br>
                    I picked up the sword, feeling its weight in my hands. It felt right, somehow.
                    <br><br>
                    Talhand nodded approvingly. "Interesting choice. Now, show me what you can do with it."
                    <br><br>
                    For the next hour, Talhand put me through my paces. He had me demonstrate basic forms, then moved on to more complex maneuvers. Despite my exhaustion from my long journey, I found myself falling into the familiar rhythms of combat. The sword became an extension of my body, just as my energy manipulation had once been.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, Talhand called a halt. He was trying to hide it, but I could see he was impressed. "Not bad, not bad at all" he said. "You've had training before, haven't you?"
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, not trusting my self to speak. The workout had brought back memories of my training with Felix, and with them, a fresh wave of guilt.
                    <br><br>
                    "Well, you've got potential, I'll give you that" Talhand continued. "But being an adventurer is about more than just fighting skills. It's about judgement, teamwork, and knowing your limits." He paused, considering. "Tell you what. I'll start you at F-Rank. You'll train with me and take on some basic quests. If you prove yourself, you can work your way up the ranks."
                    <br><br>
                    I felt a surge of excitement. This was it - my chance to learn about this new world, to find a place in it. Maybe even a chance at redemption.
                    <br><br>
                    "Thank you" I said. "I won't let you down."
                    <br><br>
                    Talhand chuckled. "Save the thanks for when you've survived your first quest. Now,  let's get you registered and find you some proper gear. You can't go adventuring looking like you've just crawled out of the Dark Forest… even if you have."
                    <br><br>
                    As I followed Talhand back into the guild hall, my mind was already racing with possibilities. What kind of quests would I be taking on? What secrets would I uncover about this world? And most importantly, would I ever find a way to fix the damage I had done?
                    <br><br>
                    Only time would tell. But for now, I had a new purpose, a new identity. Junius Dordia, F-Rank Adventurer. It was time to see what this new world had in store for me.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          The Adventurer's Guild bustled with activity as I pushed open the heavy wooden doors. The familiar scent of sweat greeted me, along with the boisterous laughter of successful adventurers celebrating their latest conquests. It had been several months since I first stepped foot in this place, a lost soul in a world I barely recognized.
                    <br><br>
                   "Junius!" Talhand's gruff voice called out from behind the quest board. "Come here, lad. I've got something for you."
                    <br><br>
                   I made my way through the crowd, nodding at familiar faces. Some of them still looked at me with a mix of awe and wariness. I couldn't blame them. My rapid rise through the ranks had been unprecedented.
                    <br><br>
                   "What is it, Talhand?" I asked, approaching my former teacher.
                    <br><br>
                   "You've been promoted again. Congratulations, you're now a D-Rank adventurer."
                    <br><br>
                   A sense of pride swelled in my chest, but I kept my expression neutral. "Thank you. I couldn't have done it without your guidance."
                    <br><br>
                   Talhand laughed, clapping on my shoulder. "Don't sell yourself short, lad. I've never seen anyone master techniques as quickly as you do. It's almost like… magic."
                    <br><br>
                   I tensed slightly at his words but forced a smile. If only he knew how close to the truth he was. The chemical that my grandfather injected in me when I was little didn't just gave me the ability to store and manipulate energy at will, but also great physique and very high endurance. But I couldn't risk anyone finding out about it.
                    <br><br>
                   "Just lucky, I guess" I said. "So, what king of quests can I take on now?"
                    <br><br>
                   Talhand's expression grew serious. "With your new rank, you can start tackling some of the more dangerous missions. But be careful, Junius. The jump from E-Rank to D-Rank is significant. Don't let your success go to your head."
                    <br><br>
                   I nodded. "I won't."
                    <br><br>
                   As I turned to leave, Talhand called out once more. "Oh, and Junius? There's been a talk among the guild members. They've started calling you 'The Blade' because of your swordsmanship. Though you should know."
                    <br><br>
                   I paused, surprised by this information. A nickname already? It seemed my efforts to blend in hadn't been entirely successful. Still, there was a part of me that couldn't help but feel a little pleased.
                    <br><br>
                   "Thanks for letting me know." I said, before heading out to tackle my first D-Rank quest.</p>

        <div class="page" id="ch28">
            <h1 class="title">Chapter XXVIII <br><span>( Chapter 28 )</span></h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          The forest was unnaturally quiet as I crept through the underbrush,  my hand resting on the hilt of my sword. Sweat beaded on on my forehead, a mix of humid air and the tension coiling in my gut. This was supposed to be a routine extermination quest, but something felt… off.
                    <br><br>
                   I had been tracking the Retile for days now. The massive mutated spider had been terrorizing nearby villages, its venom capable of liquefying a man from the inside out. The thought made me shudder.
                    <br><br>
                   A twig snapped behind me, and I turned around, sword drawn in an instant. Nothing. Just the shadows playing tricks on my eyes. I took a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart.
                    <br><br>
                   "Come on, Junius" I muttered to myself. "You've faced worse than this."
                    <br><br>
                   But had I? in the months since joining the Adventurer's Guild, I had tackled increasingly dangerous quests. Yet none of them had filled me with this level of dread. Perhaps it was the stories I'd heard from other adventurers - tales of the Retile's intelligence, its almost human-like cunning.
                    <br><br>
                   A rustle in the leaves above caught my attention. I looked up, scanning the branches, and that's when I saw it. Eight glowing red eyes stared back at me.
                    <br><br>
                   The Retile lunged at me.
                    <br><br>
                   I rolled to the side, barely avoiding its massive fangs. The spider was enormous, easily the size of a small house. Its carapace gleamed with an unnatural iridescence, and I could see my own terrified reflection in its multifaced eyes.
                    <br><br>
                   There was no time to think. I drew my sword, ready for the battle. The sword I was carrying was a Katana, it was custom made by one of the most talented blacksmiths in the village. It was sharp, light, and easy to handle. As the Retile charged again, I met its attack head-on.
                    <br><br>
                   Our battle raged through the forest, a deadly dance of steel and venom. I managed to land several blows, but the spider's armor was tough. My arms ached from the effort, and I could feel my energy depleting rapidly.
                    <br><br>
                   In a moment of the desperation, I attempted a risky maneuver. As the Retile reared up to strike, I slid beneath it, driving my sword upwards into its softer underbelly. The creature let out an ear-piercing shriek, its legs flailing wildly.
                    <br><br>
                   One of its sharp appendages caught my arm, tearing through flesh and muscle. I cried out in pain, nearly dropping my sword. The Retile, mortally wounded but still dangerous, collapsed on top of me.
                    <br><br>
                   I lay there, pinned beneath its body, my vision blurring from pain and exhaustion. As consciousness began to slip away, one thought came to my mind: I should have listened to Talhand. I should have joined a group.
                    <br><br>
                   The last thing I remember before darkness took me was the faint sound of voices in the distance. Had someone come to my rescue? Or was this the end of my journey.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Chapter XXIX <br><span>( Chapter 29 )</span></h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          I awoke to the gentle touch of a cool cloth on my forehead. My eyes fluttered open, struggling to focus in the dim light of what appeared to be a small cabin. The scent of medical herbs was strong in the air.
                    <br><br>
                   "He's awake!" a voice called out, and suddenly I was surrounded by familiar faces - fellow adventurers from the guild.
                    <br><br>
                   "Junius, you crazy bastard" one of them, a burly man named Goran, said with a mix of admiration and exasperation. "Taking on the Retile alone? You're either the bravest or the most stupid man I've ever met."
                    <br><br>
                   I tried to sit up but winced as pain shot through my arm. "How… how did you find me?"
                    <br><br>
                   An Arf man, Liam stepped forward. "We were on a mission when we heard the chaos. By the time we got there, you were out cold beneath the monster's corpse. It's a miracle that you survived."
                    <br><br>
                   The reality of how close I had come to death hit me like a physical blow. I had been reckless, overconfident in my abilities. It was a harsh lesson, but one I needed to learn.
                    <br><br>
                   "Thank you" I said. "I owe you my life."
                    <br><br>
                   Goran shook his head. "No need for that. But maybe consider joining our group? Strength in numbers and all that."
                    <br><br>
                   I nodded with a small smile. "I think I've learned that lesson the hard way."
                    <br><br>
                   Over the next few weeks, as I recovered from my injuries, I spent more time with Goran, Liam, and the others. We shared stories, trained together, and took on missions as a team. It was a new experience for me, working closely with others, trusting them with my life. I had to be careful not to reveal too much about my past or my abilities, but for the first time since waking up in this changed world, I felt like I belonged.
                    <br><br>
                   Six months passed in what felt like the blink of an eye. My skills continued to improve, honed by the challenged we faced and the guidance of my teammates. Before I knew it, I found myself standing in front of the guild master, receiving my promotion to A-Rank.
                    <br><br>
                   "Congratulations, Junius" the old man said. "Or should I say, 'The Blade'? That's what they're calling you now, you know."
                    <br><br>
                   I accepted the new badge with a mix of pride and humility. "Thank you, sir. But I couldn't have done it without my team."
                    <br><br>
                   As I left the guild, walking down the street to my little room in a hotel nearby, someone called my name. "Mr. Junius!", I turned around to see who's calling.
                    <br><br>
                   I spotted Paul running down the street, his face flushed with excitement. "Hey, Paul! Where have you been hiding?" I called out, waving.
                    <br><br>
                   He slowed to catch his breath, a grin spreading across his face. "Man, it's been ages! How have you been keeping?"
                    <br><br>
                   "Can't complain," I said, noting his unusually energetic state. "What's got you running around like there's a monster on your tail?"
                    <br><br>
                   Paul's eyes lit up. "Actually, I've got something that might interest you. You know that new school they're building on the east side?"
                    <br><br>
                   "The one near the old marketplace? What about it?"
                    <br><br>
                   "Well," he paused, practically bouncing on his heels, "they're looking for teachers. Someone who knows the old ways, the important stuff people need to learn. And I immediately thought of you."
                    <br><br>
                   I let out a short laugh. "Me? Paul, I'm an adventurer. I hunt monsters and explore ruins. I don't exactly scream 'respected educator.'"
                    <br><br>
                   "That's exactly why you'd be perfect!" Paul insisted, his voice earnest. "Think about it – who better to teach the next generation than someone who's actually been out there? Someone who's seen what's left of the old world and knows what it takes to rebuild?" He gestured at the partially rebuilt city around us. "These kids need more than just books. They need someone who can prepare them for what's really out there."
                    <br><br>
                   I crossed my arms, considering his words. The idea of settling down had never crossed my mind, but something about the way he described it stirred something in me. "A teacher, huh?" I mused, more to myself than to him.
                    <br><br>
                   "Just... think about it," Paul said, his excitement mellowing into something more serious. "We're not just surviving anymore. We're rebuilding. Maybe it's time for adventurers to pass on what they know."
                    <br><br>
                   I paused, considering the offer. Teaching at a school would provide stability, a chance to pass on my knowledge to others. It might also give me more opportunities to research ways to fix my bracelet.
                    <br><br>
                   With a smile, I nodded. "Okay, I'll do it."
                    <br><br>
                   As I walked home with Paul, my mind was already racing with plans for the future. Little did I know that my greatest challenge - and my greatest joy - was waiting just around the corner, in the form of something no one could expect.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>          As I stood in front of my new class at the school, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. I, Junius Dordia, once known as Leo Silva, had come a long way from the confused boy who woke up from a twelve year coma. Now, at the age of 21, I was an A-Rank adventurer and a newly minted teacher.
                    <br><br>
                   The classroom was small, with only ten students, whose age was probably around 18, but their eager faces filled me with excitement. As I began my introduction, my eyes were drawn to a beautiful girl sitting in the front row. She had long blonde hair that cascaded down her shoulders like a golden waterfall, and her emerald green eyes sparkled with intelligence. Two tiny white horns peeked out from her hair, marking her as one of the Arves.
                    <br><br>
                   I felt my heart skip a beat, but I quickly composed myself. "Welcome, everyone. I'm Junius Dordia, and I'll be your teacher for this year. Together, we'll hone your knowledge and prepare you to be the future of this world."
                    <br><br>
                   As I spoke, I couldn't help but steal glances at the blonde girl. Her name, I learned, was Emily Firl. Throughout the lesson, she hung on my every word. When she asked questions, her voice was melodious, and I found myself looking forward to hearing it again.
                    <br><br>
                   By the end of the class, I was both exhilarated and conflicted. I had never felt this way about anyone before, but I knew that as her teacher, I had to maintain a professional distance. Still, as Emily came after class to ask a few more questions, I couldn't help but hope that our paths would cross again outside the confines of the school.</p>
